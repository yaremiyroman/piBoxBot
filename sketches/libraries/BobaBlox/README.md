BobaBlox is an Arduino library that makes it easier to sketch code for basic hardware components. I've found that in teaching introductory Arduino workshops, that the repetitiveness of typing numerous commands just to make an LED blink   can get in the way of learning overall programming concepts. So, I developed BobaBlox. It was initially designed to work with the Adafruit Trinket, but works equally well on standard Arduino models.

Here's an example of using BobaBlox in the standard blink example. First, standard blink:

    void setup() {
    	pinMode (13, OUTPUT);    }
    
    void loop() {
    	digitalWrite (13, HIGH);
    	delay (500);
    	digitalWrite (13, LOW);
    	delay (500);	    }
    
When this is written using BobaBlox, it becomes:

    #include <BobaBlox.h>
    LED light(13);
    
    void loop () {
    	light.blink();    }

In this case, setup() isn't required (though it has to be placed in the code). In addition, there are different versions of the blink method for changing the pin, number of blinks, the on-time, and off-time.

The same holds true for the other elements in BobaBlox: Button, Knob, Photocell, and Speaker. In addition to the list, below, documentation for methods implemented for each element is in the associated example application when the library is installed.

In addition to the documentation, below, see the example BobaBlox sketches when the library is installed.

##Installation

The library is installed like other Arduino libraries. You can download a zip of the library and install it using Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library ... . BobaBlox should also be available in the Arduino Library Manager. Install using the Library Manger by choosing: Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries ... . Then, search for and select BobaBlox.

##LED

LED's are connected between an Arduino pin and ground, typically with a resistor in series.

####Declaration

    LED led_name(pin);
    
*led_name* is the name of the LED variable being declared.  
*pin* is the number of the pin being used for the LED.

####Methods

    void on ();								// Turns the LED off
    void off ();							// Turns the LED on
    void set (state);						// Sets LED on if state is greater than zero
    void blink ();							// Blinks LED once with default 250ms on and off
    void blink (n);							// Blinks n times with default blink delay
    void blink (n, delay);					// Blinks n times with specific delay
    void blink (n, delayON, delayOFF);		// Blinks n times with delayON and delayOFF
    void setBrightness (brightness);		// On a PWM  pin, sets LED brightness (0-255)

##Button

Buttons are connected between a pin and ground. The internal pullup resistor is used, so no other external components are required.

####Declaration

    Button button_name(pin);
    
*button_name* is name of the button variable being declared.  
*pin* is the number of the pin being used for the button. Its mode will be set to *input_pullup*.

####Methods

    int state ()							// Returns 0 for up, 1 for down
    boolean isDown ()						// Returns true is button is down, false otherwise
    boolean isUp ()							// Returns true if button is up, false otherwise
    boolean wasPressed ()					// Returns true when a button is pressed
    boolean wasReleased ()					// Returns true when a button is released

***Notes:***

The Button methods use basic debouncing, but may have difficulties with "noisy" buttons. Also, *wasPressed()* and *wasReleased()* are more responsive the more frequently they are called. In a simple loop without a lot of *delay()* calls, it should be reasonably responsive.

##Knob

Knobs are potentiometers. This element assumes that the "outside" leads of the Knob are connected to *ground* and *VCC*, respectively. The center lead is connected to an Analog Input pin.

####Declaration

    Knob knob_name(pin);
    
*knob_name* is name of the knob variable being declared.  
*pin* is the number of the pin being used to connect the Knob.

####Methods

    int value ();								// Returns the current value (0-1023)
    int value (int rangeStart, int rangeEnd)	// Returns value mapped to specified range

***Notes:***

Potentiometers return values from 0 to 1023 on the 10-bit Arduino ADC. However, the range for setting the brightness of an LED, for example, is 0-255. Often, this is change in range is accomplished by using the *map()* function. However *map()* can be a bit complicated to understand. The version of *value()* that allows you to specify the range to return does the mapping automatically and is more straightforward.

##Photocell

Photocells are identical to Knobs in implementation. This element assumes that the one lead from the photocell is connected to *VCC*. The other lead is connected to *ground* through a series resistor. The point where the photocell and series resistor are joined is connected to an Analog Input pin.

####Declaration

    Photocell photocell_name(pin);
    
*photocell_name* is name of the Photocell variable being declared.  
*pin* is the number of the pin being used for the photocell.

####Methods

    int value ();								// Returns the current value (0-1023)
    int value (int rangeStart, int rangeEnd)	// Returns value mapped to specified range

***Notes:***
*
The notes from the Knob section apply here.

##Speaker

In standard Arduino, speakers can be controlled using the tone() method. This is not available on the Trinket. So, the Speaker object implements related ways to make sound using one or two pins (see notes, below).

####Declaration

    Speaker mySpeaker(pin)						// One speaker is pin, the other is ground
    Speaker mySpeaker(pin1,pin2)				// Speaker is connected between Pin1 and Pin2

***Notes:***

Often, a speaker is connected between one Arduino pin and ground. However, in the case of a Piezo, this can result in barely-audible audio. One technique to increase volume is to connect the speaker across two pins. This will drive the Piezo both positive and negative (rather than positive, then zero for a one-pin connection). This is handled by BobaBlox and results in double the volume.

####Methods

    void beep (frequency, length, color);		// Beeps at frequency for length with color
    void tone (frequency, color);				// Continuous tone at frequency and color
    void start ();								// Starts tone (if it's been stopped)
    void stop ();								// Stops the tone (if its running)
    void frequency ();							// Returns the last set frequency
    void color ();								// Returns the last color

***Notes:***

*frequency* is the pitch of a tone. It is a positive integer.  
*length* is in milliseconds.  
*color* refers to the nature" of the sound. It will change with values from 0.0 - 1.0

*beep()* is just like the tone() Arduino function. It will pause the loop while the sound is playing.
*tone()* plays a tone continuously, monitoring it as the function is called repeatedly in *loop()*. In order for tone() to be effective, it must be called frequently at the top level of *loop()*.
